(2022/05/06) Doing some experimental jobs based on NoiseTransfer2Clean.   
(2022/05/09) Add a automation shell script for automated download of EMPIAR dataset.   
(2022/05/15) Started to noise extraction for the EMPIAR10077 subsets.   
(2022/06/01) Added noise synthesizing script. Started 320x320 GAN training.   
(2022/06/27) Lots of utils. Started 512x512 GAN training(including model adjustments).   
(2022/06/30) After verification of the GAN performance.   
(2022/07/12) After verification of RANDOM, RandGauss. Clean Repository.   
(2022/07/21) After verification of tomsimGaussV3. Clean. Reoranize. Integrate workflow.   
(2022/08/25) Clean. Remove BulkRenamer.   
(2022/09/26) Stochastic Extract Ended. Started to replace U-net.   
TODO : Clean Extract / Reorganize Report in Extract / More clean standardNT2C.py
